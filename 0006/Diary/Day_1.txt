At the best of times, conference calls can be unwieldy, from the guy who fails to mute the flushing toilet, to the latecomers who join midway through and ask questions that have already been answered. And then there are the people who get dropped off ¡ª and the inevitable beeping sound of rejoining.

There¡¯s no body language to cue up your eager-to-speak moment, none of the visuals of face-to-face communication. With so many voices struggling to be heard interrupting is the norm. So how can you interject without being rude?
